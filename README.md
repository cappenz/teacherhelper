AI helper for teachers.

## How It Works
  This system integrates several AI models and platforms to transcribe, contextualize, and verbally respond to educational queries via audio.

## Tools Used
-Whisper
  Whisper is a powerful model developed by OpenAI that transcribes spoken language into text. It serves as the first step in processing the   input by converting spoken questions into a written format that other models can understand.

-Llama Index and GPT
  Llama Index works alongside GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to enhance the transcriptions provided by Whisper. These models add     necessary context and generate answers that are not only accurate but also pedagogically aligned with educational objectives.

-Eleven Labs
  Eleven Labs technology is used to convert the text responses generated by GPT into high-quality, lifelike audio. This makes the responses   more engaging and easier for students to understand, mirroring a natural teacher-student interaction.

-Discord
  Discord acts as the user interface where students can submit their questions and receive answers. It is crucial for interaction   management, providing a familiar and accessible platform for users to engage with AI Teacher Helper.

-GitHub
  All source code, documentation, and updates are hosted on GitHub. This allows for collaborative development and easy access to the           project's resources for users and developers interested in the project’s methodology or wishing to contribute.
## Example

If I ask the question ‘Hi Cynthia, Tell me about Alexander the Great’ it will first say one of 3 acknowledgement phrases like ‘Stop rushing me, your teacher and I are trying to find the answer to your question.’ then it will prepare the file and say ‘Here's your file!’ and send you the file!

The file will be a video of Cynthia saying “Alexander the Great was a historical figure who traveled along the Silk Road and was responsible for opening trade routes. He is known for his conquests and for spreading Greek culture throughout the regions he conquered.”
